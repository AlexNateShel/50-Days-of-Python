s = 'love live and laugh'

# Write a function called multiply words that takes a string as an argument and multiplies the length of each word in the string by the length of other words in the string.
# For example, the string above should return '240: love (4), live (4), and laugh (5)'.
# However, your function should only multiply words with all lowercase letters.
# If a word has one uppercase letter, it should be ignored.
# For example, the following string:
t = 'Hate war love Peace' 
# Should return '12 - war (3) and love (4)'.
# Hate and Peace will be ignored because they have at least one uppercase letter.
