# Create three classes for three car brands: 'Ford', 'BMW', and 'Tesla'.
# The instance attributes of the car's objects will be model, color, year, transmission, and whether the car is electric or not (a Boolean value).
# Consider using inheritance in your answer.

# You will create one object for each car brand.

# bmw1: model: x6, Color: silver, Year: 2018, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False
# tesla1: model: S, Color: beige, Year: 2017, Transmission: Auto, Electric: True
# ford1: model: focus, Color: white, Year: 2020, Transmission: Auto, Electric: False

# You will create an instance method called 'print_cars' that will be able to print out objects of the class. 
# For example, if you call the method on ford1 object of the Ford class, your function should be able to print out the car infor in this exact format:

# car_model = focus
# Color = White
# Year = 2020
# Transmission = Auto
# Electric = False
