# Day 50: Create a Flask App

### In this challenge, you will get to create an app using Flask. Flask is a Python web framework. Learning to build websites with Flask is a very important skill to have if you want to get into web development. You will build an app using Python, HTML, and CSS. I recommend using Visual Studio Code for this challenge. You can still use whatever editor or IDE you are comfortable with. You are going to create an app with two pages, the home page and the about page. Your website will have a navigation bar, so you can move between the home page and the about page. It will have a background image.

### Flask does not come with Python, so you will have to install it on your machine and import it into you script. If you have never made a wesbite before, this challenge will require some research. I suggest using a virtual environment for your project. Good luck. I believe in you.
